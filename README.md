Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, reasoning, learning, language understanding, and decision-making. AI systems aim to mimic human cognition and behavior.

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on enabling machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms identify patterns in data and make decisions or predictions based on these patterns. For example, an ML model can predict house prices based on historical data. The key idea is that the model improves over time as it is exposed to more data.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that models high-level abstractions in data by using architectures composed of multiple layers of processing units, typically artificial neural networks. These networks are called "deep" because they consist of many hidden layers between the input and output layers. Each layer in the network learns increasingly complex representations of the data, enabling the system to automatically learn features and make predictions or decisions from large datasets.
